# Linux Environment
This repository includes four parts of settings:
1. bashrc
2. vimrc
3. tmux.conf
4. font (Hack)

## BASH
Contents of bash settings locate at `bashrc`. Do not directly add the contents into your ~/.bashrc, cause this will lead to the difficulty of debugging. Instead, one should only include a line into `~/.bashrc`
